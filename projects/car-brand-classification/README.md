# 🚘🚗🏎️ Car Brand Classification using (YOLOv8 + CNN)

Implemented a two-stage car brand classification pipeline for improved accuracy and robustness. In the first stage, used the YOLOv8 object detection model to 
identify and localize distinctive car features such as logos, grills, and other brand-specific regions. These detected regions were then cropped and used as input 
for the second stage—a custom CNN model trained to classify various car brands. This approach enhanced feature focus, reduced background noise, and significantly 
improved classification performance by leveraging object detection and deep learning in tandem.

# ðŸ¤’ CNN Based Skin Disease Dection 

Designed a CNN-based skin disease classification system using MobileNetV2 to identify multiple skin conditions including Atopic Dermatitis, Melanoma, Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Tinea/Ringworm/Candidiasis, and Vascular Lesions. Implemented a multi-phase learning strategy to progressively improve model accuracy and generalization. Focused on lightweight architecture, efficient feature extraction, and robust training using advanced techniques such as data augmentation, phase-wise fine-tuning, and performance monitoring for reliable medical image classification.

# ❤️ Artificial Neural Network(ANN) Based Heart Disease Detection

Built an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based heart disease prediction model achieving 98% accuracy. The architecture consisted of three dense layers, optimized using the Adam optimizer, and enhanced with Early Stopping, learning rate scheduling, and model checkpoints to prevent overfitting and improve generalization. Focused on deep learning techniques for classification, model tuning, and robust performance evaluation.

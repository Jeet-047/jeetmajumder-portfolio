# â™‹ Oral Cancer Detection Using Transfer Learning

Developed an oral cancer detection system using transfer learning with the VGG16 model, achieving 85% accuracy. The architecture was extended with three custom dense layers and trained using the Adam optimizer, incorporating Early Stopping, learning rate scheduling, and model checkpoints for optimal performance. Emphasized robust data preprocessing techniques including data generalization and augmentation, along with detailed result analysis to ensure model reliability and accuracy.
